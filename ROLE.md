# ROLE OF QUALITY ASSURANCE IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Software quality assurance is the process of ensuring the quality of software
that it meets the required it meet the desired quality measures.
Software Quality Assurance is implemented in various types of software models.
SQA is used to test the software, rather than checking the quality after completion.
SQA processes, test for quality in each phase of development until the software is complete.
With the SQA the software development moves to the next phase if the current phase of software
is compiled with required quality standards. SQA works on one more standards that help in building
software quality guidelines and implementation strategies. These include ISO 9000 and capability maturity model CMM. 

## Different activities of SQA are as follows

1. Maintaining the quality of the system as per the specification and business requirements.
2. Defect prevention and formal methods for other defect prevention technique.
3. Defect Reduction
4. Direct fault detection and removal without executing the project scenario.
5. Testing the project for Failure observation and bug removal.
6. Risk identification
7. Defect tracking techniques and methods. Software fault tolerance. Concluding remarks and maintaining reports.

Software quality can be quantified into two major groups 

## Software function quality:
It basically shows how well a software product conforms to the basic design, based on functional requirements. 

## Software structural quality:
It reflects on how well the project meets the non functional requirement such as usability, accessibility and security that helps in proper the delivery of the requirement. 

Software tester faces a great deal of pressure to get their product during the released under budget and time.
So the developers and testers need to take every opportunity to effectively manage the quality of their products or risks.
To maintain the quality of the software the QA managers need to able to gauge the effectiveness of their organization.
